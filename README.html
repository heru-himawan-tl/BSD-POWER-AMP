<h1 id="bsd-power-amp---audio-power-amplifier-circuit-design-released-under-bsd-license">“BSD POWER AMP” - Audio Power Amplifier Circuit Design Released Under BSD License</h1>
<p>The “BSD POWER AMP” is collection of original designs of audio power amplifier circuits released under the modified “0-Clause License” of BSD License. BSD POWER AMP focused to the application of class-AB principle and implementation of BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor). Some models under BSD POWER AMP also implement class-TD (Tracking Digital) stepper system to gain better efficiency and durability, especially these designed to operate with symmetrical dual power supply voltage at about 100V DC or above.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-name-of-bsd-power-amp">About The Name of “BSD POWER AMP”</h2>
<p>“BSD” itself is an abbreviation of “Berkeley Software Distribution”. However, “BSD POWER AMP” is nothing to do with Berkeley University of California in which the Regents of the University of California is the author of BSD License; it is only a name in which the works are released under BSD License.</p>
