# "BSD POWER AMP" - Audio Power Amplifier Circuit Design Released Under BSD License

The "BSD POWER AMP" is collection of original designs of audio power amplifier
circuits released under the modified "0-Clause License" of BSD License. BSD
POWER AMP focused to the application of class-AB principle and implementation
of BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor). Some models under BSD POWER AMP also
implement class-TD (Tracking Digital) stepper system to gain better efficiency
and durability, especially these designed to operate with symmetrical dual
power supply voltage at about 100V DC or above.

## About The Name of "BSD POWER AMP"
"BSD" itself is an abbreviation of "Berkeley Software Distribution". However,
"BSD POWER AMP" is nothing to do with Berkeley University of California in
which the Regents of the University of California is the author of BSD
License; it is only a name in which the works are released under BSD License.
